</ul>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2><p>For use with Node, this package can be installed with npm,
by creating a new directory / folder, for example <strong><code>meeks-prf</code></strong>,
and then from the command line, changing to that directory and running
the command:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">npm install @dcary/meeks-prf-js</code>
</code></pre><p>You can then tabulate a contest with the command:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">node . input.json results.json</code>
</code></pre><p>where the file <strong><code>input.json</code></strong> has the contest input data and
<strong><code>results.json</code></strong> is the output file to which results will be written.
A sample input file is provided at <strong><code>./uses/sample-01-in.json</code></strong>.</p>
<p>More generally, if the current directory is not the project directory,
you can use the command:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">node path-to/meeks-prf input.json results.json</code>
</code></pre><p>Other ways of using the package are described below.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Use this Javascript package to count votes for a
ranked choice voting (RCV) /
single transferable vote (STV) election contest
using the Proportional Representation Foundation&apos;s
 <a href="https://prfound.org/resources/reference/reference-meek-rule/">reference rule for Meek&apos;s method</a> and
various extension to that rule.</p>
<p>The Javascript programs in this package can be directly used
in modern browsers.
The package also includes versions of those programs that have been
converted for use in Node.
Use in other browsers requires additional support not included in
this package.</p>
<p>Meek&apos;s method is a form of RCV / STV that supports proportional
representation in multi-winner elections.
It can provide a fairer and more comprehensive transfer of surplus
than other forms of STV,
including variations of the weighted inclusive Gregory method (WIGM)
which also involves transfers of surplus as fractions of a vote.
Any form of STV tends to provide fairer results than other
traditional election methods
and greatly reduces the practical opportunities for tactical
voting.
Meek&apos;s method tends to accomplish these goals
better than other forms of STV.
However the trade-off is that Meek&apos;s method is more computationally
intensive,
to the extent that it is typically not practical to count votes with
Meek&apos;s method without the assistance of a computer for contests with
more than a few winners.</p>
<p>The reference rule published by the Proportional Representation
Foundation is particularly significant because it ensures that
independent but conforming implementations will always produce the same
result, provided that any ties are consistently resolved.</p>
<h2 id="version">Version</h2><p>This is version 1.0.0 of the Meeks-PRF-js project.
It has stable, well tested functionality.
Unlike earlier versions, this version is intended for general use.
With this version, discrepancies about the &apos;type_of_altdefs&apos; option
were resolved for its default value to be &apos;if_no_new_electeds&apos;.
This version includes functionality that is similar to v3.0.0 of
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/David-Cary/meeks-prfound/src/master/">a related Python project</a>,
with some additional improvements.</p>
<h2 id="repository-structure">Repository structure</h2><p>The <strong><code>src</code></strong> directory contains the Javascript
vote counting programs that can be run directly in modern browsers and
which are ES modules.
The <strong><code>run</code></strong> directory has corresponding programs that can run in
Node v10 and later.  The <strong><code>tests</code></strong> directory contains
test programs and data.  The <strong><code>docs</code></strong> directory has public API
documentation as HTML.</p>
<p>The vote counting tabulation algorithm can be invoked with the
<strong><code>Meek.tabulate()</code></strong> function, where <strong><code>Meek</code></strong> is the imported /
required name
for the <strong><code>meek.js</code></strong> file from either the <strong><code>src</code></strong> or <strong><code>run</code></strong>
directories.  Those files contain additional documentation
about the <strong><code>tabulate()</code></strong> function.</p>
<h2 id="use-examples">Use Examples</h2><p>Three ways to run a Meek&apos;s method tabulation are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#markdown-header-caller-gives-data-directly">Caller gives data directly</a></li>
<li><a href="#markdown-header-caller-gives-data-in-json-files">Caller gives data in JSON files</a></li>
<li><a href="#markdown-header-command-line-using-json-files">Command line using JSON files</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="caller-gives-data-directly">Caller gives data directly</h3><p>After importing / requiring <strong><code>meek.js</code></strong>, for example with:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">import * as Meek from &apos;path-to/src/meek.js&apos;;</code>
</code></pre><p>tabulation of RCV votes can be accomplished by calling the
<strong><code>Meek.tabulate()</code></strong> function, which is defined with the signature:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">function tabulate(nbrSeatsToFill, candidates, ballots,
      maxRankingLevels, tieBreaker, excluded, protectedzz,
      options={}, progressCallback=null):</code>
</code></pre><p>For example:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">const results = Meeks.tabulate(1, &quot; A B C&quot;, [
      [4, &apos; A B C&apos;],
      [3, &apos; B A C&apos;],
      [2, &apos; C B A&apos;]
      ],
      3, &apos; C A B&apos;, &apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;, {}, null);</code>
</code></pre><p>will tabulate a contest that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produces one winner.</li>
<li>Has three candidates with identifiers A, B, and C.</li>
<li>Has nine ballots, two of which rank C first, B second, and A third.</li>
<li>Allows a voter to rank up to three candidates.</li>
<li>Uses a tie breaker ranking for resolving ties, picking for
elimination the earliest ranked candidate of any tied candidates; so
C is picked for elimination if tied with A or B (or both) and A is
picked for elimination if tied only with B.</li>
<li>No candidates are excluded from the tabulation.</li>
<li>No candidates are protected from defeat and thus assured of being
elected.</li>
<li>Does not specify any special tabulation options.</li>
<li>Does not use a progress callback function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above example uses a short cut for specifying a sequence of strings
by writing them in a single, delimiter-separated string with the first
character specifying what the delimiter is.</p>
<p>The result of the function is a data object that includes the following
three properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>&apos;elected&apos;, a set of winners.</li>
<li>&apos;statuses&apos;, a data object showing the status of each candidate.<ul>
<li>Whether the candidate was elected or defeated.</li>
<li>The round in which the candidate was elected or defeated.</li>
<li>The candidate&apos;s vote total when elected or defeated.</li>
<li>The candidate&apos;s keep factor for the last tabulation iteration.</li>
<li>Whether the candidate was pre-designated as being excluded or
protected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&apos;tally&apos;, a data object showing the round-by-round vote totals and
other statistics of the tabulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the example mentioned above, the results would be as if the
following assignments had occurred:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">results.elected = new Set([&apos;B&apos;])
results.statuses = {
      &apos;A&apos;: Status(&apos;A&apos;, &apos;defeated&apos;, 2, D(4.0), D(1.0)),
      &apos;B&apos;: Status(&apos;B&apos;, &apos;elected&apos;,  2, D(5.0), D(1.0)),
      &apos;C&apos;: Status(&apos;C&apos;, &apos;defeated&apos;, 1, D(2.0), D(0.0))
      }
results.tally = {
      &apos;A&apos;: [D(4.0), D(4.0)],
      &apos;B&apos;: [D(3.0), D(5.0)],
      &apos;C&apos;: [D(2.0),],
      &apos;:Votes for candidates&apos;: [D(9.0), D(9.0)],
      &apos;:Overvotes&apos;: [D(0.0), D(0.0)],
      &apos;:Abstentions&apos;: [D(0.0), D(0.0)],
      &apos;:Other exhausted&apos;: [D(0.0), D(0.0)],
      &apos;:Total votes&apos;: [D(0.0), D(0.0)],
      &apos;:Quota&apos;: [D(4.500000001), D(4.500000001)],
      &apos;:Total surplus&apos;: [D(0.0), D(0.499999999)],
      &apos;:Iterations&apos;: [1, 1]
      }</code>
</code></pre><p>where <strong><code>D</code></strong> is an alias for the <strong><code>Decimal9</code></strong> class, which is
used internally to represent numbers of votes.</p>
<h3 id="caller-gives-data-in-json-files">Caller gives data in JSON files</h3><p>An alternative way to run a tabulation is with the
<strong><code>WithJson.tabulate()</code></strong> function, where <strong><code>WithJson</code></strong> is the name for
the default export from the <strong><code>with_json.js</code></strong> file.
That function reads the
tabulation input from a named JSON file and writes the results in a JSON
format to a file.</p>
<p>For example, the previous example can be tabulated using a file named
<strong><code>example.json</code></strong> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">{
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;An example RCV contest&quot;
  ,&quot;nbrSeatsToFill&quot;: 1
  ,&quot;candidates&quot;: &quot; A B C&quot;
  ,&quot;ballots&quot;: [
    [4, &quot; A B C&quot;],
    [3, &quot; B A C&quot;],
    [2, &quot; C B A&quot;]
    ]
  ,&quot;maxRankingLevels&quot;: 3
  ,&quot;tie_breaker&quot;: &quot; C A B&quot;
  ,&quot;excluded&quot;: &quot;&quot;
  ,&quot;protected&quot;: &quot;&quot;
  ,&quot;options&quot;: {}
}</code>
</code></pre><p>and then executing the Javascript statement:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">async [const results, tab_spec] = WithJson.tabulate(
      &apos;example.json&apos;, &apos;example-results.json&apos;)</code>
</code></pre><p>which writes a file <strong><code>example-results.json</code></strong> with the following
content:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">{
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;An example RCV contest&quot;
  ,&quot;elected&quot;: [&quot;B&quot;]
  ,&quot;status&quot;: [
    [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;elected&quot;, 2, 5.0, 1.0],
    [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;defeated&quot;, 2, 4.0, 1.0],
    [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;defeated&quot;, 1, 2.0, 0.0]
  ]
  ,&quot;tally&quot;: {
    &quot;B&quot;: [3.0, 5.0],
    &quot;A&quot;: [4.0, 4.0],
    &quot;C&quot;: [2.0],
    &quot;:Votes for candidates&quot;: [9.0, 9.0],
    &quot;:Overvotes&quot;: [0.0, 0.0],
    &quot;:Abstentions&quot;: [0.0, 0.0],
    &quot;:Other exhausted&quot;: [0.0, 0.0],
    &quot;:Total votes&quot;: [9.0, 9.0],
    &quot;:Quota&quot;: [4.500000001, 4.500000001],
    &quot;:Total surplus&quot;: [0.0, 0.499999999],
    &quot;:Iterations&quot;: [1, 1]
  }
}</code>
</code></pre><p>If the second argument is omitted or set to the empty string, the JSON
output is printed to <strong><code>stdout</code></strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>results</code></strong> return value is the same as returned by the
<strong><code>Meek.tabulate()</code></strong> function.  The second return value is a data
object that documents the merged tabulation input specifications.  It
reflects what was found in the input JSON file and any included files.
The input JSON file can have an &apos;include&apos; property with a value that is
a list of JSON file names from which other property/values are included,
but which can be overridden by corresponding property/values in the
primary input JSON file.</p>
<p>In the above example, the lines indicating that there are no excluded
candidates and no protected candidates could be omitted, since those are
the default values for JSON files.</p>
<h3 id="command-line-using-json-files">Command line using JSON files</h3><p>A third way to run an RCV tabulation is from the command line using
Node. This was mentioned in the quick start section.
The previous example could be run as:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">node path-to/run example.json example-results.json</code>
</code></pre><p>If the <strong><code>example-results.json</code></strong> argument is omitted or given as an
empty string, the JSON results are printed to <strong><code>stdout</code></strong>.</p>
<p>Note that the second command line value, the one following &apos;node&apos;,
can name either the project directory or its <strong><code>run</code></strong> directory.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2><p>Tests can be run using Jest.  When this package is installed using
npm, Jest is also installed as one of its development dependencies.</p>
<p>To run tests, change the working directory to the
<strong><code>tests</code></strong> directory and run the command:</p>
<pre><code><code class="source-code prettyprint">npm run test</code>
</code></pre><p>That should run 21 test suites with a total of 559 tests,
all without errors, typically in less than 15 seconds,
though speeds can vary depending on the type of computer being used.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of tests in the <strong><code>tests</code></strong> directory tree:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>more traditional unit tests specified in
<strong><code>tests/unit/*test.js</code></strong>
files and which are typically dependent on the internal design and
implementation details of programs in the <strong><code>src</code></strong> directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>tests with inputs and expected results that are specified in JSON
files and which are designed to be typically applicable to any
conforming implementation of the reference rule, except for those
tests that apply to extensions to the reference rule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The JSON-based tests are typically run from a *test.js file in the same
directory as the JSON files specifying the test.  A group of related
tests are specified in similarly named JSON files, sometimes sharing a
base JSON file for common data.  For example, files <strong><code>abc-007-1.json</code></strong>
and <strong><code>abc-007-2.json</code></strong> might specify two related tests and reference
(include and possibly override) a common <strong><code>abc-007-base.json</code></strong> file.</p>
<p>The JSON files specify a JSON object which is convertible to a
Javascript data object and which includes a <strong><code>&quot;description&quot;</code></strong>
property.</p>
<p>Global parameters for the JSON-based test cases may be set in the file
<strong><code>tests/all-tests-spec.json</code></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2><p>This implementation focuses on the core vote counting algorithms and
does not offer all of the functionality that might be expected to
support tabulation of an election. For example, it does not directly
supply support for end-user report formats.</p>
<p>Neither the programs nor the test cases enforce specific maximum
limitations on the sizes of input to the STV tabulation.  Sizes of
contests that can be tabulated generally depend on the amount of
resources, especially memory, available to the software.</p>
<p>This package can reliably handle large numeric values up to
9,000,100 to nine decimal places of accuracy. The program will not
accept more than that many ballots as input, even if they have been
pre-summarized into fewer ballot groups.</p>
<p>Numeric values much larger than that start to lose precision when
converting to or from native Javascript number values and to or
from JSON number values.</p>
<p>This implementation can use ballot trees to more efficiently process
large numbers of ballots with larger numbers of rankings.  However this
version does not attempt to strictly minimize the resources that are
used or to manage a time vs. space tradeoff.</p>
<p>As an example of what this program can accomplish,
it has tabulated in a desktop browser
non-trival contests with half a million individual ballots,
none of them pre-summarized into multi-ballot ballot groups,
each ballot ranking 100 candidates,
and the contest electing 20 winners.
Such tabulations complete within a few minutes.
Due to special cases that result in persistently slow convergence rates,
it is possible that smaller contests could take extraordinarily long
to tabulate.</p>
<p>In order to focus on issues of core functionality, all test data has been
limited to using ASCII characters.</p>
<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2><p>This implementation includes several extensions to the reference rule.
These include::</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling anomalous ranking patterns.</li>
<li>Reporting some exhausted votes as abstentions.</li>
<li>An option to always count votes for at least one round.</li>
<li>An option for whether or in which rounds to check for
perform alternative defeats
(a.k.a. multiple defeats).</li>
<li>An option for when in a round to check for
performing alternative defeats.</li>
<li>Support for vacancy re-tabulations,
including the ability to designate some candidates as being excluded
(a.k.a. withdrawn)
and others as being protected
from defeat and thus be assured of being elected.</li>
<li>An option for helping tabulations run faster by internally
representing the rankings of ballots and ballot groups in a
ballot tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this section briefly describes each of these extensions.
The extensions are also described
in the HTML-based documentation of the public API.</p>
<p>The anomalous ranking patterns that are allowed include::</p>
<ul>
<li>duplicate rankings (ranking the same candidate more than once at
different ranking levels)</li>
<li>overvoted rankings (ranking two or more different candidates at
the same ranking level on a ballot)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference rule implicitly assumes that these anomalous ranking
patterns do not occur in the ballots submitted for tabulation.  See the
documentation for the <strong><code>Meek.Tabulation</code></strong> class for the
specifics of how these anomalous ranking patterns are handled.</p>
<p>There is an option, turned on by default, that counts votes for the
first round even if doing so is not required to determine all winners
because there is not an excess of hopeful candidates.  The reference
rule can be strictly followed in this regard by using the option
<code>{&quot;always_count_votes&quot;: false}</code> in Javascript or JSON.
The value of this option has no effect if
there is an excess of hopeful candidates and as a result, counting votes
for one or more rounds is required to determine winners.</p>
<p>There are two options that control whether and how alternative defeats
are performed.
Alternative defeats can involve defeating one or more candidates at a
point in the tabulation when no candidates or only one candidate would
be defeated.
Alternative defeats are also known as multiple defeats, batch defeats,
and deferred surplus distribution.
By default, alternative defeats are not performed.</p>
<p>Alternative defeats can be activated
with the <strong><code>alternative_defeats</code></strong> option,
setting it to a value of &quot;Y&quot; value
or activating it only for certain rounds
with a sequence of &quot;Y&quot;s and &quot;N&quot;s.</p>
<p>There is also an option, <strong><code>&quot;type_of_altdefs&quot;</code></strong>,
that controls the point in the tabulation algorithm
at which the alternative defeats is checked.
In order for this option to have an effect on a round,
the <strong><code>&quot;alternative_defeats&quot;</code></strong> option
must be a <strong><code>&quot;Y&quot;</code></strong> for the round.
In addition to doing the check at the end of step B.2.e,
as allowed by the reference rule,
there are also options to check in the middle of step B.2.e,
if no candidates were elected in the iteration,
or to check at the beginning of step B.3,
just before doing end-of-round single defeats.</p>
<p>There is support to exclude and protect candidates.  An excluded
candidate is not eligible to be elected or receive votes and is marked
as defeated before the first round of tabulation.  The reference rule
uses the term &quot;withdrawn&quot; rather than &quot;excluded&quot;.  A protected candidate
is assured of being elected.</p>
<p>The ability to exclude and protect candidates can be useful when using
the ballots of a previous election to fill one or more vacancies.  For a
typical use case, exclude all previous candidates who are unwilling or
otherwise not eligible to fill the vacancies, protect all candidates
that will continue to serve, set the number of seats to fill to the sum
of the number of protected candidates plus the number of vacancies to
fill, and then retabulate the contest.</p>
<p>When there are protected candidates, there are separate quotas for
protected candidates and unprotected candidates in order to ensure that
an excess of unprotected candidates will not be elected.</p>
<p>In order to help tabulations run faster for larger constests, there are
options to use a ballot tree to represent ballots internally.
If used, the ballot tree can be either static or dynamic.</p>
